# V3 Process: Subtractive Sculpting

## Concept

V3 inverted the v2 approach. Instead of starting minimal and building up, **start with chaos and sculpt it down**. The premise: there's an image hidden inside randomness—the artist's job is to find it.

Also relaxed the constraint from v2. Rather than "one property per edit," v3 allowed larger moves when the piece called for them. The micro-edit discipline remained, but wasn't rigid.

## The Evolution

### Phase 1: Chaos (001)

**001-chaos**: Generated 16 rectangles with random positions, sizes, and saturated colors. Pure noise—no composition, no hierarchy, no harmony. The starting material to sculpt.

### Phase 2: Muting the Noise (002-004)

**002-mute-magenta**: Started muting the loudest colors. Changed #c4c → #a8a8a8. One less screaming element.

**003-mute-red**: The red bar (#c44) was isolated on the left. Muted to #b0a0a0.

**004-mute-orange**: Orange bar (#c84) at bottom-left muted to #b8a898.

*Observation*: This one-at-a-time approach was too slow/precious. The constraint needed loosening.

### Phase 3: Finding Structure (005-006)

**005-depth-attempt**: Major leap. Instead of muting colors individually, reorganized all elements by depth:
- FAR: Small, muted, high on canvas
- MID: Medium, semi-muted
- NEAR: Large, more saturated, low on canvas

Added background gradient. Suddenly the chaos became a landscape.

**006-ground-plane**: Added explicit ground plane (horizon at y=290). Now clearly reads as abstract cityscape. Reduced element count, organized more deliberately into layers.

### Phase 4: Adding Life (007-009)

**007-lit-window**: One small golden rectangle (#e8c878) on the center building. Human presence. Warm focal point against cool palette.

**008-dusk**: If there's a lit window, it's evening. Warmed the lower sky (added amber/coral tones), darkened the buildings. The scene acquired time of day.

**009-two-windows**: One window felt lonely. Added second on right building (#e8b050). Two lives in the city, subtle dialogue across the skyline.

### Phase 5: Refinement (010-012)

**010-richer-sky**: Enriched sky gradient with coral/mauve midtones. Deeper blue at top. Full evening atmosphere.

**011-simplified**: The foreground horizontal bars (remnants from chaos) weren't serving the composition. Removed them. Ground plane now clear, composition breathes.

**012-wet-street**: Tried adding subtle horizontal line suggesting wet pavement. Almost invisible—filed under "experiments that didn't earn their place."

### Phase 6: Fresh Eyes (013)

**013-final**: Stepped back after the journey.

Removed:
- The wet street line (too subtle to matter)
- Two distant buildings (5 → 3, less fussy)

Small adjustments:
- Window positions tweaked for visibility
- Building positions refined for balance

Result: Evening cityscape. Depth, atmosphere, human presence.

## Key Learnings

1. **Chaos contains images.** The random starting point had potential cityscapes, landscapes, abstract compositions. The artist's job is to see one and pull it out.

2. **Constraints should serve the work.** The "one property per edit" rule from v2 was too rigid here. When I broke it (005), the piece leapt forward. Constraints are tools, not laws.

3. **Subtractive work needs additive moments.** Even though v3 was about sculpting down, the key additions (windows, dusk sky) made the piece. Subtractive ≠ only removal.

4. **Time of day creates mood.** Adding dusk (008) transformed the piece from "rectangles suggesting buildings" to "evening in a city." Context creates meaning.

5. **Two is more than twice one.** One lit window is a detail. Two lit windows is a conversation. The second window (009) added more than the first.

## Comparison: V2 vs V3

| Aspect | V2 | V3 |
|--------|----|----|
| Starting point | Single circle | 16 random rectangles |
| Direction | Additive → subtractive | Subtractive throughout |
| Constraint | One property per edit (strict) | Micro-edits (flexible) |
| Final image | Eclipse over water | Evening cityscape |
| Iterations | 22 | 13 |
| Key breakthrough | Glow became eclipse (011) | Depth reorganization (005) |

Both found: depth, atmosphere, warm accents against cool palettes, human/natural elements.
